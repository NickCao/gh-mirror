gh-mirror is a simple way to mirror a user's GitHub repositories locally and
keep them updated. See [the blog post I wrote it for][blog] to get more
information about how to use it in a useful way.

# Running

    gh-mirror [user]

This will mirror all repositories for a user to the current working directory.
